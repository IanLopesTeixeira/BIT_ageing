!Series_summary = There is a marked heterogeneity in human lifespan and health outcomes for people of the same chronological age. Thus, one fundamental challenge is to identify molecular and cellular biomarkers of aging that could predict lifespan and be useful in evaluating lifestyle changes and therapeutic strategies in the pursuit of healthy aging. Here, we developed a computational method to predict biological age from gene expression data in skin fibroblast cells using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. We generated an extensive RNA-seq dataset of fibroblast cell lines derived from 133 healthy individuals whose ages range from 1 to 94 years, and 10 patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease. On this dataset, our method predicted chronological age with a median error of 4 years, outperforming algorithms proposed by prior studies that predicted age from DNA methylation [4–8] and gene expression data [6,9] for fibroblasts. Importantly, our method consistently predicted higher ages for Progeria patients compared to age-matched controls, suggesting that our algorithm can identify accelerated aging in humans. These results show that the transcriptome of skin fibroblasts retains important age-related signatures. Our computational tool may also be applicable to predicting age from other genome-wide datasets.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Human dermal fibroblasts documented as ‘apparently healthy individuals’ deposited from the National Institute of Aging or the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository were obtained or purchased from the Coriell Biobank Cell Repository (Camden, New Jersey, USA). The cells were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1X glutamax (Gibco), 1X non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). HGPS patient fibroblasts were obtained from the Progeria Research Foundation and were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine medium and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-strepomycin. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM unless specified and were maintained at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 3% O2 and 7.5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2 to 5 days at 85% confluence.
